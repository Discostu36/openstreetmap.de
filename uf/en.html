        <h2 id="why_black">Why do I see these black squares?</h2>
        <p>On 26 March 2019, the European Parliament will vote for a third time on the new EU Copyright Directive. Article 13 of the new directive will de-facto force content platforms to filter uploaded contributions by their users. If a platform does not prevent uploading of copyright-protected content in accordance with "high industry standards of professional diligence" (i.e. upload filters), the operator of the platform is liable for copyright violations of their users. The new rules do not affect large platforms, such as Google, Youtube and Facebook. Small, independent and free platforms like OpenStreetMap would be forced to introduce such filters. This threatens our project.</p>
        <p>In addition, article 11 introduces a protection for press publications for online use following the German model, although the law has proofen unsuccessful there.</p>

        <h2 id="why_political">Why do you use the map for your political statements?</h2>
        <p>We do not do this deliberately. The European Parliament passed the bill on 12 September 2018 despite noticeable civil society protest. Since then, the European Commission, the Council of Europe and representatives of the parliament, negotiated a compromise. It is expected that the parliament will vote on the compromise in the last week of March. We think that passing the bill would harm the OpenStreetMap and many other small and medium-sized platforms - regardless if they are commercial or not. Black map tiles would not be the result, but with OpenStreetMap investing more resources on pre-filtering content than on anything else, the project would be a shadow of its former self. If nothing changes, a dark future awaits us.</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenStreetMap
            Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.fossgis.de/">FOSSGIS
            e.V.</a>, the official local chapter in Germany, campaign for free map
            data. We usually do so in financial and technical matters but sometimes we
            are forced to become active in politics to defend the project.</p>


        <h2 id="what_is_osm">What is OpenStreetMap?</h2>
        <p>OpenStreetMap was founded in 2004 and is a international project to create a
        free map of the world. To do so, we, thousands of volunteers, collect
        data about roads, railways, rivers, forests, buildings and a lot more
        worldwide. Our map data can be downloaded for free by everyone and used
        for any purpose – including commercial usage. It is possible to produce
        your own maps which highlight certain features, to calculate routes
        etc.</p>
        <p>OpenStreetMap is increasingly used when one needs maps which can be very quickly, or easily, updated, such as ambulance services, fire brigades,
        humanitarian development and humanitarian crises response.</p>

        <h2 id="no_filters_in_directive">But the directive does not mention upload filters, does it?</h2>
        <p>The term is not used in the current version of the draft. But operators of platforms will be liable for copyright violations of their users if they do not meet the following conditions:
        <ol>
            <li>They must have made "best efforts" to get a licence to use the uploaded content.</li>
            <li>They must have made best efforts to ensure that their platform does not publish content if copyright holders have provided them with the necessary information.</li>
            <li>If they are informed about a copyright violation, they have to remove the content, or disable access to them, immediately.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Until now, platforms were excepted from strict liability if they reacted immediately to a notification of a copyright violation. This new directive would force platforms to use either upload filters or review all contributions manually. Upload filters are the high industry standard of professional diligence. For example, Google uses them on Youtube.</p>

        <h2 id="whats_problem">What's the problem with upload filters?</h2>
        <p>Upload filters have a number of issues for small and medium sized and/or free and independent platforms like OpenStreetMap and Wikipedia:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>These filters <b>do not work as reliable as required</b>. Even now, and definitely under the new directive, they tend to be too zealous, by erring on the side of caution and excluding more than they should.</li>
            <li>The operators of small and medium sized platforms will be <b>forced to purchase the filter technology from large companies</b> to keep up with the current state of filtering technology. This gives more power, and money, to large companies, centralizing their power even more.</li>
            <li>The rules will affect any website where users can upload copyrighted content. These are not only social networks but blog with comments and forums as well. Small and new platforms lack the required financial resources to buy the filters. They will be exempted from the first and second condition (attempt to get a license and prevent uploads of copyrighted contents) if they annual turnover is below EUR 10 million and they are less than 3 years old. But three years are a short time. If the number of users exceeds 5 million, condition 3 (prevent re-upload of illegal contents) must be met.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The directive aims to oppose the business model of big US companies. Indeed, the business model of Google and others is not laudable but the directive will harm small and medium sized competitiors, not the large ones.</p>

        <h2 id="why_harm">Why do upload filters harm OpenStreetMap?</h2>
        <p>The OpenStreetMap project emphasizes openness. Map changes by all users, new and experienced, are applied immediately and are provided to all other data processors immediately. The map is always as up to date as possible.</p>
	<p>Upload filter are very impracticable for multiple reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>OpenStreetMap records the reality as it is. Other map data providers do the same. If OpenStreetMap compared the submissions with other datasets, many false positives would occur. Our data is if it is correct, very similar to the data of other map providers. A road in OpenStreetMap has the same curves, the same name, the same speed limit.</li>
            <li>If a user uploads changes which are held back by a filter, these changes have to be reviewed as soon as possible. This requires the time of our volunteers, who would like to improve the map rather than checking whether a filter returned a false positive.</li>
            <li>If a held contribution and a contribution of another user edit the same object in the database, a editing conflict occurs. They cannot be solved automatically because our world is too complex.  Some conflicts are not that obvious: If two users add the same recently erected building, the two of them create a new object. In reality, this is a building recorded twice in our data.</li>
            <li>If an edit by a new contributor is held back by the filter although the edit is fine, the contributor becomes demotivated due to a lack of positive feedback.</li>
            <li>The development, setup and optimisation of the filter consumes a large amount of work of our volunteer software developers. Maybe we will have to spend money to purchase services. Both the work of our volunteers and the donations and membership fees are required for other purposes where we have to keep up with technical development.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="wikipedia_aussnahme">There is an exception for Wikipedia, isn't it?</h2>
        <p>It is not clear whether the "Wikipedia exemption" would be valid for OSM and even Wikipedia does not feel confident: María Sefidari Huici, member of the board of Wikimedia Foundation, calls the proposed changes a threat for the living and free internet. The Wikimedia Foundation, the organisation behind Wikipedia, <a href="https://medium.com/freely-sharing-the-sum-of-all-knowledge/your-internet-is-under-threat-heres-why-you-should-care-about-european-copyright-reform-7eb6ff4cf321">doubts</a> that this exemption satisfies the requirements. We share these doubts.</p>
        <p>The directive has to be implemented in national law by EU member states. The implementation will not be the same among the countries. Some differences are possible. In Germany, terms like "commercial" and "business-like" are interpreted very strictly. Our data is used in commercial environments a lot. There is a couple of companies using our data and contributing back to OpenStreetMap by developing software or paying their own data contributors – or just by making OSM available to the broad public. If OpenStreetMap becomes unusable for commercial data users by the back door, it will harm all of us.</p>

        <h2 id="help">What can I do against the directive?</h2>
        <p>There are multiple options to become active:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sending emails to MEPs is not useful or effective. It is likely that would be sorted out into the spam folder and boost the (false) impression by the advocates of the directive that the folks against the directive are "Google's bots".</li>
            <li>You can phone your MEP by phone and try to convince them. <a href="https://savetheinternet.info/contact-your-mep">savetheinternet.info/contact-your-mep</a> provides phone numbers and a filter by country of origin.</li>
            <li><b>Our number one request is that you join a protest. Join one of the many demonstrations or organise one yourself.</b> There is a day of action in more then 30 cities all over Europe on 23 March. Dates and locations can be found at
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://savetheinternet.info/demos">savetheinternet.info</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2019/upload-filter-alle-demos-auf-einen-blick/">netzpolitik.org</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.stopacta2.org/stopacta2-events/">stopacta2.org</a></li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The web site <a href="https://saveyourinternet.eu/">saveyourinternet.eu</a> provides suggestions and support to get in touch with members of the European Parliament. If we succeed in explaining to enough MEPs that upload filters as described in article 13 are a bad idea, the Parliament can reject the article or the whole proposal.</p>

        <h2 id="no_banner">How can I get rid of the banner?</h2>
        <p>You can't. But it will disappear after the vote in the parliament.</p>

        <h2 id="kein_schwarz">Will you distribute black error tiles again?</h2>
        <p>We might answer every 7th request to our tile server by a black error tile. We hope that you understand that we become active against a threat to our project and use all websites using our services as our platform. We don't do this deliberately. If you really do not want to see any black tiles, we kindly ask you to switch to another (e.g. paid) map tile service based on OpenStreetMap data.</p>
