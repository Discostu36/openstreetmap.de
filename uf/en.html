    	<h1>The EU Copyright Directive will harm OpenStreetMap</h1>
  	</div>

        <h2 id="why_black">Why do I see these black squares?</h2>
        <p>On 12 September 2018 the plenary of the European Parliament will <a
            href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=AGENDA&reference=20180912&secondRef=SIT&language=EN">vote</a>
        a second time on the new EU Directive "Copyright in the Single Digital
        Market". Article 13 of this new directive will force content sharing
        platforms on the internet to check contributions of their users for
        potential copyright violations. OpenStreetMap would be required to
        introduce such filters. This threatens our project.</p>

        <h2 id="why_political">Why do you use the map for your political statements?</h2>
        <p>We do not do this deliberately. We think that carelessly passing of
        draft by the European Parliament would harm the OpenStreetMap
        substantially. Black map tiles would not be the result but we would
        have an OpenStreetMap which spend more resources on pre-filtering of
        content than on anything else – the project would be a shadow of its
        former self. If nothing changes, a dark future expects us.</p>

        <p>The <a
            href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenStreetMap
            Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.fossgis.de/">FOSSGIS
            e.V.</a>, the official local chapter in Germany, campaign for free map
            data. We usually do so in financial and technical matters but sometimes we
            are forced to become active in politics to defend the project.</p>


        <h2 id="what_is_osm">What is OpenStreetMap?</h2>
        <p>OpenStreetMap is a international project founded in 2004 to create a
        free map of the world. To do so, we, thousands of volunteers, collect
        data about roads, railways, rivers, forests, buildings and a lot more
        worldwide. Our map data can be downloaded for free by everyone and used
        for any purpose – including commercial usage. It is possible to produce
        your own maps which highlight certain features, to calculate routes
        etc.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, OpenStreetMap is used increasingly where up to date and
        easily to improve maps are required: ambulance services, fire brigades,
        humanitarian development and humanitarian crises response.</p>

        <h2 id="why_harm">Why do upload filters harm OpenStreetMap?</h2>
        <p>The OpenStreetMap project emphasizes openness. Map changes by new
        users are applied on the database immediately and are provided to other
        data processors via download interfaces. Therefore, the map is always
        as up to date as possible.</p>
	<p>Upload filter are very impracticable for multiple reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>OpenStreetMap records the reality as it is. Other map data
                providers do the same. If OpenStreetMap compared the
                submissions with other datasets, many false positives would
                occur. Our data is if it is correct, very similar to the data of
                other map providers. A road in OpenStreetMap has the same curves,
                the same name, the same speed limit. It will be even more difficult if
                it comes to points of interests such as shops, restaurants etc. These
                facilities are usually submitted by their owners to
                multiple data providers at the same time. Should every service reject the
                submission because another provider has accepted it already?</li>
            <li>If a user uploads changes which are hold back by a filter due to
                a suspected copyright violation, these changes have to be
                reviewed in timely manner. This requires the time of our
                volunteers who like to improve the map more than checking whether a
                filter returned a false positive.</li>
            <li>If a hold contribution and a contribution of another user edit
                the same object in the database, a editing conflict occurs. They
                cannot be solved automatically because our world is too complex.
                Some conflicts are not that obvious: If two users add the same
                recently erected building, the two of them create a new object. In
                reality, this is a building recorded twice in our data.</li>
            <li>If an edit by a new contributor is hold back by the filter
                although the edit is fine, the contributor becomes
                demotivated due to a lack of positive feedback.</li>

            <li>The development, setup and optimisation of the filter consumes a
                large amount of work of our volunteer software developers. Maybe
                we will have to spend money to purchase services. Both the work
                of our volunteers and the donations and membership fees are required
                for other purposes where we have to keep up with technical
                development.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="wikipedia_aussnahme">There is an exception for Wikipedia, isn't it?</h2>
        <p>It is not clear whether the "Wikipedia exemption" would be valid for
            OSM and even Wikipedia does not feel confident: María Sefidari Huici,
            member of the board of Wikimedia Foundation, calls the proposed changes
            a threat for the living and free internet. The Wikimedia Foundation,
            the organisation behind Wikipedia,
            <a href="https://medium.com/freely-sharing-the-sum-of-all-knowledge/your-internet-is-under-threat-heres-why-you-should-care-about-european-copyright-reform-7eb6ff4cf321">doubts</a>
            that this exemption satisfies the requirements. We join this
            doubts.</p>
        <p>The directive has to be implemented in national law by the members of the
        European Union. The implementation is not equal among the countries. Some
        differences are possible. In Germany, terms like "commercial" and "business-like"
        are interpreted very strictly. Our data is used in commercial environments a
        lot. There is a couple of companies using our data and contributing back to
        OpenStreetMap by developing software or paying their own data contributors – or
        just by making OSM available to the broad public. If OpenStreetMap becomes
        unusable for commercial data users by the back door, it will harm all of us.</p>

        <h2 id="dumme_idee">Why are upload filters a stupid idea?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Absurd reversal of the burden of proof</b> The requirement to
                ensure the lawfulness of uploaded contents by the operator at
                their costs, puts them under a general suspicion and results in
                a reversal of the burden of proof.</li>
            <li><b>Absurd disparity of means</b> In order to catch a small
                proportion of copyright violations, the freedom of all is
                restricted. How should a journalistic analysis be possible if it
                is not allowed to quote short snippets of news?</li>
            <li><b>Wrong decision in case of doubt</b> The guideline to refrain from
                publication in case of doubt, contradicts fundamentals of law
                ("when in doubt, for the accused") and is a restriction of
                personal freedom. Content will be hold back even if there is the
                suspicion of a copyright violation only.</li>
            <li><b>Disadvantage of small competitors</b> Small platforms which
                have to get along with small budgets are forced to purchase the
                required fiter technology from large software monopolists. It
                is not a financial discrimination only. It makes them depend on
                their competitiors in economical and legal matters and destroys the
                a innovative and free market.</li>
            <li><b>Unequal treatment</b> The desire to except "desireable
                services" like Wikpedia from regulation, calls all other
                services as "undesireable" and boils down in cencorship. Who
                will decide which services are desireable and which are not?</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="help">What can I do against the directive?</h2>
        <p>The web site <a
            href="https://saveyourinternet.eu/">saveyourinternet.eu</a> provides
            suggestions and support to get in touch with members of the European
            Parliament. If we succeed in explaining enought MEPs that upload filters
            as described in article 13 of the proposed Copyright Directive are a bad
            idea, the parliament can reject the article or the whole proposal.</p>

        <h2 id="kein_schwarz">How can I get rid of the black error tiles?</h2>
        <p>You can't (it is implemented on server side). But we will restore the old state in a few days.</p>
