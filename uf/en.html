    	<h1>The EU Copyright Directive will harm OpenStreetMap</h1>
  	</div>

        <h2 id="warum_schwarz">Why do I see these black squares?</h2>
        <p>On 12 September 2018 the plenary of the European Parliament will <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=AGENDA&reference=20180912&secondRef=SIT&language=EN">vote</a> a second time on the new EU Directive "Copyright in the Single Digital Market". Article 13 of this new directive will force content sharing platforms on the internet to check contributions of their users for potential copyright violations. OpenStreetMap would be required to introduce such filters. This threatens our project.</p>

        <h2 id="warum_politisch">Why do you use the map for your political message?</h2>
        <p>We don't do this deliberately. We think that accepting the unmodified drafts in the European Parliament will harm the OpenStreetMap project seriously. Black tiles would not be the result but an OpenStreetMap required to spend more of its resources on a pre-commit filtering of contents than on anything else – the project would be a shadow of its former self. If nothing changes, we all face dismal prospects.</p>

	<p>The <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenStreetMap Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.fossgis.de/">FOSSGIS e.V.</a> advocate for free map data. We mainly do so in technical and financial matters but sometimes we have to become active politically as well tosafeguard the interests of OpenStreetMap. This is such a case.</p>

        <h2 id="was_ist_osm">What is OpenStreetMap?</h2>
        <p>OpenStreetMap is a international project founded in 2004 aiming to create a free map of the world. To do so, we, thousands of volunteers, collect information on roads, railways, rivers, forests, buildings and much more all over the world. Our map data can be downloaded and re-used for any purpose by anyone for free – even for commercial usage. It is possible to make your own maps and render things differently, calculate routes etc.</p>

        <h2 id="warum_schlecht">Why do upload filters harm the OpenStreetMap project?</h2>
        <p>The OpenStreetMap project emphasises openess. Contributions by new users are included into our dataset immediately and are provided to other data processors via update interfaces. Therefore, our map is always as up to date as possible.</p>
        <p>Upload filters are impracticable for OpenStreetMap for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>OpenStreetMap records the reality as it is. Other map data providers do so as well. If OpenStreetMap had to compare contributions with data of other providers, false positives would be usual. Our data is if it right very similar to data of others. A road has the same curves in our and their data, the same name, the same speed limit. It will be even worse with shops, restaurants etc. These facilities are submitted by their owners to multiple data providers at the same time. Should every service reject the submission because another provider has recorded it already?</li>

            <li>If a user uploads changes which are hold back by a filter due to a suspected copyright violation, these changes have to be reviewed in timely manner. This requires the time of our volunteers who like to improve the map more than checking whether a filter came to a wrong decision.</li>

            <li>If a hold contribution and a contribution of another user edit the same object in the database, a editing conflict occurs. They cannot be solved automatically because our world is too complex. Some conflicts are not that obvious: If two users add the same recently erected building, the two of them create a new object. In reality, this is a building recorded twice in our data.</li>

            <li>If an edit f a new contributor is hold back by the filter although the edit is fine, the new contributor becomes demotivated due to a lack of positive feedback.</li>

            <li>The development, setup and optimisation of the filter consumes a large amount of work of our volunteer software developers. Maybe we will have to spend money to purchase services. Both the work of our volunteers and the donations and membership fees are required for other purposes where we have to keep up with technical development.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="wikipedia_aussnahme">There is an exception for Wikipedia, isn't it?</h2>
        <p>It is not sure whether the "Wikipedia exception" mentioned in the media applies for OpenStreetMap as well. Even Wikipedia thinks that it is not sufficient: The chairperson of, María Sefidari Huici, calls the proposed directive a threat to the living and free internet: The Wikimedia Foundation, the organisation behind Wikipedia <a href="https://medium.com/freely-sharing-the-sum-of-all-knowledge/your-internet-is-under-threat-heres-why-you-should-care-about-european-copyright-reform-7eb6ff4cf321">doubts</a> that the exception is useful at all. We thinks so as well.</p>
        <p>The directive has to be implemented in national law by the members of the European Union. The implementation is not equal among the countries. Some differences are possible. In Germany, terms like "commercial" and "business-like" are interpreted very strictly. Our data is used in commercial environments a lot. There is a couple of companies using our data and contributing back to OpenStreetMap by developing software or paying their own data contributors – or just by making OSM available to the broad public. If OpenStreetMap becomes unusable for commercial data users by the back door, it will harm all of us.</p>

        <h2 id="dumme_idee">Why are upload filters a stupid idea?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Absurd reversal of the burden of proof</b> The requirement to ensure the lawfulness of uploaded contents by the operator at their costs, puts them under a general suspicion and results in a reversal of the burden of proof.</li>
            <li><b>Absurd disparity of means</b> In order to catch a small proportion of copyright violations, the freedom of all is restricted. How should a journalistic analysis be possible if it is not allowed to quote short snippets of news?</li>
            <li><b>Wrong decision in case of doubt</b> The guideline to prohibit of publication in case of doubt, contradicts fundamentals of law ("when in doubt, for the accused") and is a restriction of personal freedom. Content will be hold back even if there is the suspicion of a copyright violation only.</li>
            <li><b>Discrimination of small competitors</b> Small platforms which have to get along with small budgets are forced to purchase the required fiter technology from giants of software industry. It is not a financial discrimination only. It makes them depend on their competitiors in economical and legal matters and destroys the a innovative and free market.</li>
            <li><b>Unequal treatment</b> The desire to except "desireable services" like Wikpedia from regulation, calls all other services as "undesireable" and boils down in cencorship. Who will decide which services are desireable and which are not?</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="mithelfen">What can I do?</h2>
        <p>The web site <a href="https://saveyourinternet.eu/">saveyourinternet.eu</a> provides suggestions and support to get in touch with members of the European Parliament. If we succeed in explaining enought MEPs that upload filters as described in article 13 of the proposed Copyright Directive are a bad idea, the parliament can reject the article or the whole proposal.</p>

        <h2 id="kein_schwarz">How can I get rid of the black error tiles?</h2>
        <p>You can't. But we will restore the old state in a few days.</p>
